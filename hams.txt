Well, Seymour, I made it, despite your directions.
Ah, Superintendent Chalmers, welcome. I hope you're prepared for an unforgettable luncheon!
Yeah.
Oh, egads! My roast is ruined! But what if I were to purchase fast food and disguise it as my own cooking? Ho ho ho ho! Delightfully devilish, Seymour.
SEEEEEYMOOUUURRR!
Superintendent! I was just...uh---just stretching my calves on the windowsill. Isometric exercise! Care to join me?
Why is there smoke coming out of your oven, Seymour?
Uh... ooh! That isn't smoke, it's steam! Steam from the steamed clams we're having. Mmmm, steamed clams!
Superintendent, I hope you're ready for some mouthwatering hamburgers.
I thought we were having steamed clams.
Oh no, I said 'steamed hams'. That's what I call hamburgers.
You call hamburgers 'steamed hams'?
Yes! It's a regional dialect.
Uh-huh. Eh, what region?
Uh...upstate New York.
Really? Well I'm from Utica and I've never heard anyone use the phrase 'steamed hams'.
Oh, not in Utica, no. It's an Albany expression.
I see.
You know, these hamburgers are quite similar to the ones they have at Krusty Burger.
Hohoho, no! Patented Skinner Burgers. Old family recipe!
For steamed hams?
Yes.
Yes, and you call them steamed hams, despite the fact they are obviously grilled.
Y- Uh.. you know, the... One thing I should... excuse me for one second.
Of course.
[yawns] Well, that was wonderful. A good time was had by all. I'm pooped.
Yes, I should be--good lord, what is happening in there?!
Aurora Borealis?
Ah- Aurora Borealis!? At this time of year, at this time of day, in this part of the country, localized entirely within your kitchen!?
Yes.
...May I see it?
...No.
Seymour! The house is on fire!
No, mother, it's just the Northern Lights.
Well, Seymour, you are an odd fellow, but I must say... you steam a good ham.
Help! HELP!
